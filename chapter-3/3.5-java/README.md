## Chapter 3: Design and Implementation

### Section 3.5 Java
**Summary:** Let's rewrite these stuff in [Java](Markov.java)!

**BONUS:** Refactor the Java code to use up-to-data structures and practices:
- Generics - `Map<Prefix, Vector<String>>` instead of `Hashtable`
- Remove use of deprecated constructor of `StreamTokenizer`
- Static constructor, instead of constructors with fields that differ from the fields of the class
