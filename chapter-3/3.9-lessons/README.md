## Chapter 3: Design and Implementation

### Section 3.9 Lessons
**Summary:** The first thing to designing a program is the data and the data structures about it. These foundations then
can be implemented in different ways with different languages, but they will more or less be the same.
Using libraries and high-level programming language can help us speed up developement, but comes at a cost of giving up
complete control of what you program does, and not knowing what happens under the hood. This is a trade-off that needs to be considered.
Finally, writing production-ready code involves iteration and experimentation.
