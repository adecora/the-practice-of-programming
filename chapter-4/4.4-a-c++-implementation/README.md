## Chapter 4: Interfaces

### Section 4.4 A C++ Implementation
**Summary:** In this chapter we will implement the same library in C++.

See the implementation in [`csv.cpp`](csv.cpp)

#### Exercise 4-5
Enhance the C++ implementation to overload subscripting with `operator[]` so that fields can be accesses as `csv[i]`.

*Answer:* Implemented directly in [`csv.cpp`](csv.cpp). See this [commit](https://github.com/asankov/the-practice-of-programming/commit/59a3bd15e0af3090a963603217589258a8c45b5a)

#### Exercise 4-6
Write a Java version of the CSV library, then compare the three implementations for clarity, robustness and speed.

*Answer:* TODO: implementation
